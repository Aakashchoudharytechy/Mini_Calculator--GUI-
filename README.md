# Mini_Calculator--GUI-
This is my very first project in Python language. In this project, I have created a simple Graphical Calculator that can perform simple tasks such as addition, subtraction, modulus, division, etc. 

I created this calculator using Tkinter module of Python.

This Calculator will perform all the basic operations.

The main highlight of this calculator is its interface as it looks very cool and it'll give a kind of dark mode effect to coders.

You can either press the buttons to choose digits and operations of the calculator or You can transcribe the expression in the entry box and can hit the enter button.

It'll work similarly to any other calculator.
